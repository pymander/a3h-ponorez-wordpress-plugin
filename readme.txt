Templates should be added to the `templates` subdirectory in this
plugin. They can contain shortcodes.

These two shortcodes load an activity from the Pono Rez database.

* **\[pr_activity id=XXX\]** - Load activity id XXX and use it to fill out the default template.
* **\[pr_load_activity id=XXX\]** - Used to load activity XXX without filling out and using a template.

These shortcodes are used to request specific attributes for the
currently loaded activity.

* **\[pr_activity_name\]**
* **\[pr_activity_description\]**
* **\[pr_datepicker\]**
* **\[pr_guest_type_list\]**
* **\[pr_guest_type\]**
* **\[pr_hotel_select\]**
* **\[pr_hotel_room\]**
* **\[pr_check_availability\]** - Print out the "Check Availability" button.
