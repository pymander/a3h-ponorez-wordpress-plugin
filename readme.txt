Add A3H Pono Rez interfaces, reservations, and tours to your WordPress site.

Tours & Attractions. The system comes equipped with a slick Ecommerce
solution, customization tools and API messaging. In addition to the
scheduling of Tours, Retail Store, Gift Certificates & Transportation

== Usage ==

Documentation for this plugin can be found in the [GitHub wiki page](https://github.com/pymander/a3h-ponorez-wordpress-plugin/wiki).

Templates only work for single-activity pages, which aren't used that
often. You are probably looking for how to use activity groups. Check
the [example page in the wiki](https://github.com/pymander/a3h-ponorez-wordpress-plugin/wiki/ActivityGroupExample) 
for good details on how to do that.

Templates should be added to the `templates` subdirectory in this
plugin. They can contain shortcodes.

These two shortcodes load a single activity from the Pono Rez database.

* **\[pr_activity id=XXX\]** - Load activity id XXX and use it to fill out the default template.
* **\[pr_load_activity id=XXX\]** - Used to load activity XXX without filling out and using a template.

These shortcodes are used to request specific attributes for the
currently loaded activity.

* **\[pr_activity_name\]**
* **\[pr_activity_description\]**
* **\[pr_datepicker\]**
* **\[pr_guest_type_list\]**
* **\[pr_guest_type\]**
* **\[pr_hotel_select\]**
* **\[pr_hotel_room\]**
* **\[pr_check_availability\]** - Print out the "Check Availability" button.
